# Mars EGA Spectrometry

Code for the NASA ML challenge: [Mars Spectrometry: Detect Evidence for Past Habitability](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/93/nasa-mars-spectrometry/)

## Models

Two simple models included: 
- MLP (only this model was used in the submission, no ensembles)
- CNN (very experimental, with the tabulard dataset converted to images using deep insight).

## Results

Achieved an AggLogLoss of **0.2170** during the first phase of the challenge with position 34/578 on the leaderboard.\
Achieved an AggLogLoss of **0.0581** during the second phase of the challenge with position 24/677 on the leaderboard.
